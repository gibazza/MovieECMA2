The upstairs neighbor’s story then splits off like an amoeba: she’s an office lady seduced by a “talent scout” who is falling down the sex industry ladder, moving from hostess, to massage girl, to private karaoke attendant. The talent scout’s story then splits off and runs in its own direction, revealing the sorry state of this young pimp’s soul. From there, the movie takes more and more time to consider the lives of more and more characters until the entire Japanese sex industry is filled with the wailing of lost souls.",

The series debuted in 22 April 2007 and became popular thanks to its funny characters, witty script, use of catchphrases and capacity to integrate and poke fun at contemporary issues; the program presents a caustic satire of many of the 'types' found in Spanish society.\n\nThe name of the show involves wordplay, as \"vecina\" is the Spanish word for neighbour.",

The series debuted in 2003 and became popular thanks to its funny characters, witty script, and capacity to integrate and poke fun at contemporary issues; the program presents a caustic satire of many of the 'types' found in Spanish society.\n\nIn 2006, Antena 3's rival Telecinco acquired a 15% share of Miramón Mendi, the company that produces the series. Miramón's contract with Antena 3 expired on June 2006 and was not renewed, bringing the series to an end, since the actors' contracts bind them to the production company and not to the network. Miramón Mendi then created a new series for Telecinco with most of the same actors and a similar setting, but with brand-new characters and storyline. La que se avecina débuted 22 April 2007.",
